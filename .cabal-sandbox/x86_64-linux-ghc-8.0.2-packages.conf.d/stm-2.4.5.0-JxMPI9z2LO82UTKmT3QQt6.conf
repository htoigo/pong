description:
    Software Transactional Memory, or STM, is an abstraction for
    concurrent communication. The main benefits of STM are
    /composability/ and /modularity/. That is, using STM you can write
    concurrent abstractions that can be easily composed with any other
    abstraction built using STM, without exposing the details of how
    your abstraction ensures safety. This is typically not the case
    with other forms of concurrent communication, such as locks or
    'MVar's.
