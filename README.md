This little Haskell application grew out of my working through Andrew
Gibiansky's excellent tutorial blog post [_Your First Haskell Application (with
Gloss)_](http://andrew.gibiansky.com/blog/haskell/haskell-gloss).  It really is
a great resource for learning to build a Haskell application using Cabal.
Thanks, Andrew!  For someone who has some experience with functional programming
or programming in Haskell, but has never built a Cabal application before, the
included code gave me a solid foundation from which to build, and the exercises,
especially, are substantial and just the right level of challenge to keep me
going until I was so engrossed in building the game that I couldn't stop
polishing until I had what you see here.  Go check it out!
