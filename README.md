## Credits

This little Haskell game grew out of my working through the excellent tutorial
blog post ["Your First Haskell Application (with
Gloss)"](http://andrew.gibiansky.com/blog/haskell/haskell-gloss) by Andrew
Gibiansky, used under [CC
BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0). It really is a great
resource for learning to build a Haskell application using Cabal. Thanks,
Andrew! For someone with some experience programming in Haskell, but who has
never before built a Cabal application, the included code gives you a solid
foundation from which to build, and the exercises, especially, are meaty with
just the right level of challenge to get you thoroughly engrossed. Go check it
out!
